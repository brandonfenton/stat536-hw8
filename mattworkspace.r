1)  The authors justify removing the quadratic trend on the basis that ARMA models rely on the assumption of stationarity.  By removing the trend the authors stated that the residuals has a constant mean of zero and constant variance.  Thus, the residuals have the necessary stationarity property to fit an ARMA model.  Furthermore, since the goal was to remove only the trend and not the variation around the trend, "simple, parsimonious methods" were given preference i.e. they did not use splines.
